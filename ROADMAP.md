# Road map

### Things to work on in the future
###### (You're welcome)

#### Wish List
* User Authentication
  * Passport
  * Local strategy
  * Facebook Strategey
* User Functionality
  * Add a track event button to event card and event page
  * Add a share button that creates a link for each unique event
  * Allow users to input their phone number or email for alerts when event time is near
  * RSVP that lists the users attending the event (Possibly a friends list functionality...)
    * Twilio?
* User View
  * User splash page will show the users upcoming tracked events
  * A past events section for users to see events that they have attended
* Only show events that are upcoming based on the time of the user's search
* EventBrite's API allows for users to create Events, add an event creation view/controller/route
* Add another Event API (NYC Open Data, MeetUp, SongKick, etc) for more results
* Refreshing the page will crash the app data, work on fix for this
* MACHINE LEARNING FOR USER PREFERENCES? :)
